# SomeML_algorithms
A repository of some fundamental machine learning algorithms that I learnt from both school and external sources jsut for fun. All algorithms are either validated by some randomly generated toy datasets or datasets by some packages such as sklearn, but the idea is very similar to 'official' algorithms that we can see from online packages.

I mainly write algorithms in .py files in the 'packages' directory and implementation in .ipynb files.

Keeps updating!
